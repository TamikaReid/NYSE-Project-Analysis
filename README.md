# NYSE Data Analysis - Year Four Insights

## Overview

In the fourth year of data analysis on the NYSE, our research revealed some fascinating insights. Specifically, the Sub-Sector: Health care Distributors emerged as the top-ranking industry in terms of total revenue, totaling an impressive $488,511,737,000.00. This achievement signifies the robust financial performance of Health care Distributors, surpassing all other sectors and sub-sectors examined.

## Data Distribution

### Right Skewness in Revenue

When examining the accompanying bar graph, we observe a distinctive characteristic known as right skewness or positive skewness. This skewness indicates that the data distribution is asymmetrical, leaning towards higher values. More specifically, it implies that the mean value ($142,630,512,000.00), representing the average, exceeds the mode (no mode), which is the most frequently occurring value. This positive skewness suggests the presence of a few high-revenue outliers, contributing to an overall higher mean value compared to the mode.

### Wider Range in Healthcare GCIS Sub-Sectors' Data

Furthermore, when we focus on the Healthcare GCIS Sub-Sectors' data, we find that the mean revenue ($142,630,512,000.00) and the median revenue ($87,284,763,000.00) are not equal. This disparity indicates a wider range within the dataset. This observation is reinforced by the standard deviation of the healthcare industry ($173,576,230,529.47), which is higher than the mean. The elevated standard deviation suggests a broader range of revenue values within the healthcare sector.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our comprehensive data analysis confirms that the Healthcare Distributors sub-sector achieved the highest revenue in year four on the NYSE. This achievement underscores the financial strength and performance of this specific industry within the healthcare sector. These insights provide valuable information for investors, analysts, and stakeholders interested in understanding the financial landscape of the NYSE.
